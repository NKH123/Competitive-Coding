It's a question of DP on trees
You need to store initial xor of all nodes in subtree of each node by DP
Then when we cut a part from a tree and if the initial XOR of a subtree containing that part was, say, val, now it will become, val^x
In this way, if we remove even number of parts, xor will be val, and if odd, then val^x
Therefore, every node will have 2 dp states, one will contain number of ways of getting xor = val, and another, val^x
Then using combinatorics, we can further find out how to do transition between different states.



************************************
Okk
Dp on trees
Convert the tree such that every node has xor of nodes of all subtree under it
odd and even
think of a recurrence involving oddd and even

**************************************
hint is dp on trees...  make grps with xor = x
************************************
Reduce the tree to 0 and x tree
First
Where each node is either 0 or x
Now think of dp on adjacent nodes
Think simple think math

A=(a+b)(x+y)-(by-ax)
B=(a+b)(x+y)+ay
